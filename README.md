## Contribute

Khan Academy team and volunteers work together to develop Windows 8 app and continuously adding new features. The features and bugs are logged in [issues](https://github.com/Khan/khan-windows-8/issues) section. If you want to contribute, pick the feature/bug you want to work on and code away. If you have a new feature idea or found a bug you want to fix, feel free to add an issue and work on that. It's a good idea to let others know you are working on something to avoid duplicate work. Once you are done with the issue, submit a pull request. We have a getting started guide on project wiki which also has the development guidelines we follow.
